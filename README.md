# MLProject
The code for the Invoice Anomaly Detector was implemented in Python using libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and SciPy. It follows a structured workflow that begins with data preprocessing, where missing values are handled, categorical features like payment terms and invoice categories are encoded, and numerical variables are normalized using StandardScaler to ensure uniformity. In the feature engineering stage, business-specific features such as Deviation_From_Vendor_Avg (difference between an invoice and the vendor’s average billing amount) and Tax_Ratio (ratio of tax to total) are created to capture realistic financial patterns. The K-Means Clustering algorithm is then applied to group similar invoices, with the optimal number of clusters determined using the Silhouette Score. Each invoice’s distance from its cluster centroid is calculated, and a dynamic threshold — defined as the mean plus two standard deviations of all distances — is used to classify invoices lying beyond this boundary as anomalies. The code also includes an interactive prediction function that allows users to input new invoice details and instantly identify whether the invoice is normal or anomalous, while also providing an explanation such as unusually high amount, very few items, or abnormal tax ratio. Model performance is evaluated using metrics like Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, and AUC, while visualizations such as confusion matrices and distance distribution plots provide deeper insights. Overall, the code integrates preprocessing, clustering, and explainable AI into a single pipeline, delivering an efficient and interpretable solution for automated financial anomaly detection.
